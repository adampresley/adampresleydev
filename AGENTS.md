## AI Rules

1. Before you change any code, first display a plan outlining what components and code is going to change, the nature of each change, and a short summary of why you are going to change it. Wait for approval before making any code changes.
2. Do not introduce new 3rd party libraries or dependencies without first consulting me, and telling my why you have to add a new dependency
3. Once you complete a task, always execute both `goimports` and `go build` to ensure the changes do not break anything. The application lives in the `cmd/streaming-tracker` directory, so that is where `go build` needs to be run from.
4. In functions that call things and checks for errors, the variable must be named `err`, and it must be defined at the top of the function
5. Prefer variable declarations at the top of functions (in a var block in parenthesis) over var declarations spread throughout the function, and over short variable declaration form
6. When calling a method that returns a value and an error, prefer single-line function call/`if err != nil` if the function being called doesn't have more than 3 arguments. If it has more than 3 arguments, it is ok to split the function call and `if err != nil`
